# Card-game
The card game Three Card War is a simple card game for two players. The game uses a 52 card conventional deck. To begin the deck is shufed and each player draws three cards. The players may look at their three cards. The remaining cards are placed in a pile facedown between the two players. The players decide who is going frst.

• The player going frst selects one of his three cards and places it face up.

• The opposing player selects one of her three cards and places it face up.

• If the ranks of both cards are the same (a push), then both players retain their cards and set them aside. Otherwise, the player with the highest-ranking card keeps both cards (again, setting them aside).

• After playing the round, each player draws one card from the deck to replace the card just played with the frst playing drawing frst.

• The player that won the round is now the frst player for the next round unless there was a push then the original frst player goes frst again.

• The game ends when the deck is exhausted and both players have played all of their three cards.

• The player with the most cards set aside wins.

Card ranking begins with the 2 as the lowest card going up to the ten, then jack, queen, king, and ace.
